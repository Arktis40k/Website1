            <td>Teddy (Andrew) wasn't truly lost; he understood the role-play and asked, "Which would be worse—to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?" because he chose the lobotomy to escape his past.</td>
            <td>His final line, his knowing look at his cigarettes, and his acceptance of the "Teddy" identity suggest a momentary return to clarity before choosing oblivion.</td>

            <td>Consipracy Theory</td>
            <td>7/10<td>
            <td>The entire island scenario was a sophisticated government plot (like MKUltra) to break Teddy, a potentially dangerous veteran, into a docile assassin or to silence him, with the "role-play" being a tool for indoctrination.</td>
            <td>The staff's strange antagonism, the missing patient number (patient #67 when there are 66 beds), and the hints of unethical experiments support this.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Setup Theory</td>
            <td>8/10</td>
            <td>The institution, possibly run by the government/CIA, wanted Teddy to believe he was a detective to lure him into a deeper psychological trap, using his trauma against him.</td>
            <td>Evidence: Dr. Sheehan (Chuck) struggling with his gun, the cryptic warnings from other staff, and the overall feeling of being manipulated point to this.</td>

<h2>Common Clues and Debates</h2>
<p>The missing patiesnt:The discrepancy in patient numbers where there is 66 beds, but they mention a missing 67th fuels the conspiracy theories. </p>
<p>Chuck's Gun:Chuck's hesitation with his gun is seen as proof he's not a real Marshal but a doctor unfamiliar with weapons. </p>
<p>The Ending:The core debate remains:Is Teddy truly gone, or is he faking to escape? No one hasn't given a definitive answer which allows each viewer a different interpretation of the movie.</p>
